# Points of Interest

[MainEditorScript.lua](https://github.com/CodeSmile-0000011110110111/LunyDevelop/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/Luny/Editor/MainEditorScript.lua) is a testbed Lua script that runs in the editor as a `ScriptableSingleton`. It has comments that explain how the script works.

Nothing else to see .. yet.

# Disclaimer

This project has no other purpose than to serve as a Luny package development environment for myself.  

Any real example projects will come later, in a separate repository or otherwise.
